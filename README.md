# hello-world
This is my first GitHub.
I have a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering but always seem to be working on software ever since my first co-op job in Huntsville, Alabama on the Redstone Arsenal. I am now looking for formalize my software skills, and achieve master status before exploring a possible career change into Data Analysis or Data Scientist.
